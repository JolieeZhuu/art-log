Art Log: An Attendance and Payment Tracker for Art Classes
---
Art Log is a full-stack web application that efficiently manages student attendances and class payments for an art studio. **It is currently a work in progress.**

#Overview
Art Log is a project I initially took up as my IB HL CS IA, but I decided I should remake it and add many more features so that it was functional for my mom's friend's art studio business. Originally, they were using Google spreadsheets with complex formulas and some code to track all of their students' attendances, missed classes, and payment deadlines. However, they came across latency and efficiency issues, and errors would always appear from time to time. I was hoping I could fix these issues by building a web app dedicated for these needs, which is why I am **currently** building Art Log!
